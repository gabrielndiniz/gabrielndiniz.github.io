                        <h2>My Journey</h2>
                        <p>I'm Gabriel Diniz, a passionate Game Developer with a background in Chemical Engineering from USP (Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). For the past 6 years, I've been on a self-directed journey to master game development, driven by my passion for creating meaningful interactive experiences.</p>
                        
                        <p>My path to game development began during my engineering studies, where I discovered that my true passion lay in creating interactive experiences that combine technical excellence with creative design. While I excelled in my engineering coursework and gained valuable analytical skills, I found myself increasingly drawn to the world of game development.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'm currently transitioning from my role as a Technical Coordinator in engineering to pursue my true calling in game development, where I can combine creativity with technical design excellence. This transition represents not just a career change, but the pursuit of a lifelong passion.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                        <p>My background in Chemical Engineering has provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and technical documentation. As a Technical Coordinator, I've developed valuable skills in project management, team collaboration, and delivering complex technical solutions.</p>
                        
                        <p>During my engineering career, I contributed to the development and implementation of two engineering document management software solutions, working with multidisciplinary teams to create efficient systems. This experience taught me how to translate technical requirements into functional solutions, a skill that transfers directly to game development.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Game Development Journey</h2>
                        <p>My game development education has been largely self-directed, combining structured online courses with hands-on project work. I've completed numerous courses on platforms like Udemy and GameDev.TV, focusing on both Unity and Unreal Engine development.</p>
                        
                        <p>I've developed several complete games, including my featured project "Too Deep To Dig," which showcases my ability to implement complex game systems including procedural generation, quest systems, and combat mechanics. I've also participated in multiple game jams, which have taught me how to scope projects appropriately and work efficiently under time constraints.</p>
                        
                        <p>My preferred engine is Unreal, where I've developed proficiency in both Blueprint visual scripting and C++ development. I'm also experienced with Unity and C# programming, and I'm always eager to learn new tools and technologies.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
                        <p>I believe that great games are born at the intersection of technical excellence and creative vision. My approach to game development is guided by a few core principles:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Player-Centered Design:</strong> Creating experiences that resonate with players and provide meaningful engagement</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical Rigor:</strong> Building robust, optimized systems that perform reliably across platforms</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Staying current with industry trends and constantly expanding my skill set</li>
                            <li><strong>Balanced Perspective:</strong> Bringing together analytical problem-solving with creative innovation</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>My unique background in engineering gives me a perspective that combines systematic thinking with creative problem-solving, allowing me to approach game development challenges from multiple angles.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                        <p>My goal is to establish myself in the game development industry where I can apply my unique perspective as someone migrating from engineering, bringing analytical problem-solving skills together with creative vision. I'm particularly interested in roles that allow me to work on innovative gameplay mechanics, procedural generation systems, or immersive interactive experiences.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'm passionate about creating meaningful interactive experiences and am open to discussing how my skills and vision can contribute to your project or team. Whether you're looking for a dedicated team member or a collaborative partner, I bring a combination of technical skill, creative thinking, and professional dedication to every project.</p>

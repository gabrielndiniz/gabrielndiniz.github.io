                <div class="interests-intro">
                    <p>When I'm not coding or designing games, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me balanced, inspired, and connected to the world around me. These interests not only provide a welcome break from screens but also inform and enrich my creative work in game development.</p>

                        <h2>Tabletop RPGs</h2>
                        <p>I'm an avid player and designer of tabletop role-playing games, which combine storytelling, strategy, and social interaction in ways that digital games often aspire to. My experience with tabletop RPGs includes:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Game Mastering:</strong> I regularly run campaigns for friends, creating immersive worlds and narratives that respond to player choices</li>
                            <li><strong>System Design:</strong> I've designed custom rule systems and mechanics for specific campaign settings</li>
                            <li><strong>Character Creation:</strong> I enjoy the creative process of developing complex characters with unique motivations and backgrounds</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Tabletop RPGs have taught me valuable lessons about player agency, emergent storytelling, and balancing structure with improvisation—all principles that I apply to my game development work.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="interest-card">

                        </div>
                        <h2>Video Games</h2>
                        <p>As a game developer, I'm also an enthusiastic player across various genres. My gaming interests span:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>RPGs and Immersive Sims:</strong> Games like the Elder Scrolls series, Deus Ex, and Disco Elysium that offer rich worlds and player choice</li>
                            <li><strong>Strategy and Simulation:</strong> Titles such as Civilization, Factorio, and Rimworld that challenge planning and systems thinking</li>
                            <li><strong>Indie Games:</strong> I'm particularly drawn to innovative indie titles that push boundaries in mechanics, narrative, or art style</li>
                            <li><strong>Retro Gaming:</strong> I maintain a collection of classic games that have shaped the industry and continue to influence design</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>I approach gaming not just as entertainment but as ongoing research—analyzing mechanics, studying design choices, and staying current with industry trends and innovations.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="interest-card">

                        </div>
                        <h2>Exercise & Physical Activity</h2>
                        <p>Maintaining physical health is essential for creative work and mental clarity. My regular physical activities include:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> I follow a consistent strength training regimen to maintain energy and focus</li>
                            <li><strong>Running:</strong> Regular runs help clear my mind and often lead to creative breakthroughs on challenging development problems</li>
                            <li><strong>Hiking:</strong> Exploring natural environments provides both exercise and inspiration for environmental design in games</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Physical activity is a crucial counterbalance to the sedentary nature of development work, helping me maintain productivity and creative energy throughout long projects.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="interest-card">

                        </div>
                        <h2>Travel & Exploration</h2>
                        <p>Experiencing different cultures, environments, and perspectives is invaluable for creative work. My travel interests include:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cultural Immersion:</strong> I seek authentic experiences that provide insight into different ways of life and storytelling traditions</li>
                            <li><strong>Natural Wonders:</strong> Exploring diverse landscapes from mountains to coastlines informs my approach to environmental design</li>
                            <li><strong>Historical Sites:</strong> Visiting places with rich histories helps me understand how architecture and environments tell stories</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Travel experiences often find their way into my game designs, whether through architectural influences, cultural references, or environmental storytelling techniques.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="interest-card">

                        </div>
                        <h2>Rock and Roll Music</h2>
                        <p>Music is both a passion and a source of inspiration for my creative work. My musical interests center around rock and roll, including:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Classic Rock:</strong> I'm drawn to the pioneering sounds of bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Rolling Stones</li>
                            <li><strong>Progressive Rock:</strong> Complex compositions from bands like Rush and King Crimson that push musical boundaries</li>

                            <li><strong>Live Music:</strong> I regularly attend concerts to experience the energy and community of live performances</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Music often influences the rhythm and pacing of my game designs, and I pay particular attention to how sound design and music can enhance player experience and emotional engagement.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>How My Interests Inform My Work</h2>
                    <p>These diverse interests don't exist in isolation from my professional work—they actively inform and enhance my approach to game development:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tabletop RPGs</strong> have shaped my understanding of player agency and emergent storytelling, influencing how I design quest systems and narrative choices</li>
                        <li><strong>My gaming experiences</strong> provide a rich reference library of mechanics, systems, and design patterns that I can analyze, adapt, and improve upon</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical activity</strong> maintains the energy and mental clarity needed for sustained creative work and problem-solving</li>
                        <li><strong>Travel experiences</strong> expand my visual and cultural vocabulary, enriching the worlds and environments I create</li>
                        <li><strong>Music</strong> influences my approach to pacing, emotional arcs, and audio design in games</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>By maintaining a rich and varied life outside of development, I bring fresh perspectives and diverse influences to my work, creating games that are more engaging, authentic, and resonant with players.</p>

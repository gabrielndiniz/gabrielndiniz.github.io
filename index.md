## About Me

![Me!](images/foto.jpg "Me!")

I'm a Chemical Engineer from USP (Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil) with a passion for game development. I have experience working in dynamic environments, and I'm a quick learner. Currently, I work as a Technical Coordinator for a high complexity engineering project for the Brazilian Navy. I've also participated in multidisciplinary teams for the development and implementation of two engineering document management software.

I have completed several game development courses from Udemy and YouTube, including:

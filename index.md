## About Me

![Me!](images/foto.jpg "Me!")

I'm Gabriel Diniz, a Game Developer with a background in Chemical Engineering from USP (Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). I thrive in dynamic environments and learn quickly. Currently, I work as a Technical Coordinator in an engineering project, but my true passion lies in game development. I've been refining my skills through personal projects and game jams while also contributing to multidisciplinary teams, helping develop and implement two engineering document management software solutions.

In addition to my engineering background, I've pursued my interest in game development through various online platforms, including Udemy and YouTube. I've completed several game development courses, acquiring skills in areas such as:

- Programming (C#, C++, and Blueprint scripting)
- Game design principles and mechanics
- Unity and Unreal Engine development
- Virtual Reality (VR) development
- Procedural generation and level design

I'm passionate about creating immersive and enjoyable experiences for players, combining my technical expertise with creative problem-solving. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with talented individuals in the game development industry.

If you'd like to discuss a potential project or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Let's create something amazing together!

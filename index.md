## About Me

![Me!](images/foto.jpg "Me!")

I'm Gabriel Diniz, a Chemical Engineer from USP (Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil), with a deep passion for game development. I thrive in dynamic environments and am a quick learner. Currently, I work as a Technical Coordinator for a high-complexity engineering project with the Brazilian Navy. I've also been part of multidisciplinary teams, contributing to the development and implementation of two engineering document management software solutions.

In addition to my engineering background, I've pursued my interest in game development through various online platforms, including Udemy and YouTube. I've completed several game development courses, acquiring skills in areas such as:

- Programming (C#, C++, and Blueprint scripting)
- Game design principles and mechanics
- Unity and Unreal Engine development
- Virtual Reality (VR) development
- Procedural generation and level design

I'm passionate about creating immersive and enjoyable experiences for players, combining my technical expertise with creative problem-solving. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with talented individuals in the game development industry.

If you'd like to discuss a potential project or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Let's create something amazing together!

I have completed several game development courses from Udemy and YouTube, including:

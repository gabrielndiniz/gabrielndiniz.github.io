### What I love
I am a buddhist that love stay with my family and friends. I do play RPG with my friends and Video Game with my little niece, amongst other activities. Also, I love to play and read alone, enjoying the company of the creation of other people. I have more than 100 books and 300 games in my collection.

### What are my skills
I am a **Chemical Engineer** from **USP - Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil)** who had several different jobs and positions. I am a quick-learner that enjoys dynamic environments.
Today, I work on Brazillian Navy as a Technical Coordinator in a high complexity engineering project. I participated on the multidisciplinary teams behind the development and implementation of two engineering document management softwares, due to the necessity of control and verification. Nowadays, I am coordinating the multidisciplinary team of sixteen people behind digital sign on these documents.
Also, I coordinate a team of nine people behind the follow-up of engineering document from all different areas of engineering and quality management, connecting four different sectors from the company (about 500 people).
